# Diabeties_Prediction_Using_SVM_ML
This is a diabetes prediction project based on the SVM machine learning model which has a dataset based on Pregnancies,	Glucose,	Blood Pressure	SkinThickness, Insulin,	BMI, Age, etc
The raw data needed preprocessing and for that, it needed standardization in the same range using scaling. Then the data was split into four  components namely X and Y . Where X is the diabetic attributes and Y is the outcome. these are further split into X_train, X_test, Y_train and Y_test.
The training data is 80% and the rest is testing data. Using **sklearn python library** the machine learning model, **Support Vector Machine (SVM) **was imported and thus trained. The model showed an accuracy of 77% with the testing data and 78% with the training data.
